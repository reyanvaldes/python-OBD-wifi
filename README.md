python-OBD-wifi
==========

A python module for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle
ports. It is derived from the python-OBD repo for serial data. This is an adaption for ELM327 Wifi compatible modules.


```

Basic Usage
-----------

```Python
import obd

connection = obd.OBD("192.168.0.10", 35000) # connect to specific OBD-II-wifi Adapter. In our case it is a Panda by comma.ai

cmd = obd.commands.SPEED # select an OBD command (sensor)

response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command, and parse the response

print(response.value) # returns unit-bearing values thanks to Pint
print(response.value.to("mph")) # user-friendly unit conversions
```
